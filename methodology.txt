3. Methodology of Prototype Implementation

Our prototype implementation establishes a modular, extensible framework for multi-strategy document retrieval, emphasizing flexibility and maintainability through consistent application of the Strategy design pattern. The system architecture comprises four primary components: document preprocessing, embedding generation, storage management, and retrieval orchestration.

3.1 System Architecture

The system employs a composite strategy approach, allowing simultaneous implementation of both dense (vector-based) and sparse (keyword-based) retrieval methods. This architectural decision enables the system to leverage the complementary strengths of different retrieval strategies while maintaining a unified interface for document retrieval operations.

3.2 Document Processing Pipeline

The document processing pipeline is implemented through a CompositeLoader class, which coordinates the preparation and storage of documents across multiple retrieval strategies. Each document undergoes strategy-specific processing:

3.2.1 Dense Retrieval Path
- Text preprocessing (optional)
- Vector embedding generation using Sentence Transformers
- Storage in ChromaDB with associated metadata and embeddings

3.2.2 Sparse Retrieval Path
- BM25-optimized text preprocessing
- SQLite storage with preprocessed text and metadata

3.3 Retrieval Mechanisms

The retrieval system implements a multi-strategy approach through the CompositeRetriever class, which manages:

3.3.1 Query Processing
- Strategy-specific query preprocessing
- Parallel query execution across multiple retrieval methods
- Query embedding generation for dense retrieval paths

3.3.2 Result Fusion
- Independent ranking by each retrieval strategy
- Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) for result list aggregation
- Metadata preservation and consolidation

3.4 Storage Infrastructure

The system implements two primary storage strategies:

3.4.1 Vector Database (ChromaDB)
- Persistent storage of document embeddings
- Efficient similarity search capabilities
- Metadata association with embedded documents

3.4.2 Relational Database (SQLite)
- Text-based search optimization
- BM25 ranking implementation
- Structured metadata storage

3.5 Extensibility Features

The prototype implements several key extensibility mechanisms:

3.5.1 Strategy Pattern Implementation
- Abstract base classes for each system component
- Standardized interfaces for strategy interchangeability
- Runtime strategy selection and combination

3.5.2 Modular Components
- Interchangeable embedding models
- Configurable preprocessing pipelines
- Extensible storage backends

This architectural approach enables straightforward integration of additional retrieval strategies, preprocessing methods, and storage solutions while maintaining system cohesion and reliability.

3.6 Technical Implementation

The system is implemented in Python, leveraging several key libraries:
- Sentence Transformers for dense vector embeddings
- ChromaDB for vector storage and retrieval
- SQLite for relational data storage
- NLTK for text preprocessing
- Rank-BM25 for sparse retrieval implementation

The prototype's modular design facilitates future extensions, including planned web scraping capabilities for document acquisition and a Streamlit-based user interface for system interaction.
